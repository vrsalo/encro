	"text-about": "<p>ENCRO is one of the largest project developers in Croatia. Our team has developed¬†<b>7 wind farms</b>¬†with a total installed capacity of¬†<b>141.4 MW.</b></p> <p>During the last¬†<b>15 years</b>, ENCRO has explored and identified locations in Croatia suitable for building wind farms and successfully develop multiple wind projects.</p> <p>With our extensive experience in engineering, supervision and renewable portfolio asset management we have also more than 1000 MW new Wind and Solar projects in the pipeline.</p> <p>Working as a pioneer in the Croatian renewable energy sector we are fully focused on the energy transition and our projects form an important part in contributing to the goal of carbon neutral Europe as envisioned by the European green deal and the ‚ÄòFit for 55‚Äô package.</p>",
	"text-vision": " <p> Following on the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the EU has led by example in setting ambitious targets for reducing net emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 and for being the first climate neutral continent by 2050. These goals are no longer aspirations or ambitions, but obligations laid down in the first European Climate Law that create new opportunities for innovation, investment and jobs.</p> <p> In this spirit the package of proposals, adopted in July 2021, aims to make the EU ‚Äòfit for 55‚Äô and deliver transformational change needed across our economy, society and industry. These measures will support Europe‚Äôs climate policy framework and put the EU on track for a 55% reduction in carbon emissions.</p> <p> One of the key instruments to reach the 2030 target is updated Renewable Energy Directive that increases the overall binding target from the current 32% to a new level of 40% renewables in the EU energy mix! </p>",
